One of the major problem that one faces is after installatopn of CMake , in which the source path is  CMakeLists not Found

Solution:
Set source path as C:\opencv\sources and then souce directory is written as C:\opencv:\build\x86\mingw and hen configured out then it gives the response that 
mingw is not present , do you wan't to create it,after pressing yes it go for default constructor ,there we have to select Mingw makeFile
and then it will create the List thereafter when screen goes  red press generate.
